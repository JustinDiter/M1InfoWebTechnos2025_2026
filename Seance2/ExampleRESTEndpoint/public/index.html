    <h1>Preset Manager for an audio sampler</h1>

    <p>This is a simple index.html HTML page that describes the REST API available on
        this server.</p>
    <p>You should modify this file to create a simple client for the presets API.</p>

    <h2>Current API :</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><a href="/api/health">GET /api/health</a></li>
        <li><a href="/api/presets">GET /api/presets</a></li>
        <li><a href="/api/presets/:name">GET /api/presets/:name</a>.
            Example: <code>/api/presets/electronic</code>
            should return the preset JSON file with the name "electronic.json"
            located in the public/presets folder.
        </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>YOUR WORK :</h2>
    <h3>First : study the files in the project!</h3>
    <p>Start with the package.json file to understand the project dependencies.</p>
    <p><b>Question 1:</b> What is this line : "dev": "node --watch index.mjs" in the package.json file?</p>
    <p>The server code is located in the src folder</p>
    <p> <b>Question 2:</b> why is the server code in the src folder? The server uses
        the express, fs and path modules with nodeJS. Where can you find the
        documentation of these modules?</p>
    <p>The preset JSON files are located in the public/presets folder.
        Look at their content! Where are the audio files located?
        How can we guess the URI of the audio files?</p>
    <p> <b>Question 3:</b> why are the preset files in the public/presets folder?</p>
    <br>
    <p>The front-end code is located in the public/js/script.js file.</p>
    <p>The front-end HTML code is located in this index.html file.</p>
    <p>The CSS code is located in the public/css/style.css file.</p>

    <p> <b>Question 4:</b> what is the purpose of the tests folder?</p>

    <p>The tests folder is used to store unit tests and integration tests for the application. These tests help ensure
        that the code behaves as expected and allows for easier maintenance and refactoring in the future.</p>
    <h3>On the back-end part:</h3>
    <p>You should implement the following features in the REST API located in the
        src/app.mjs file:</p>
    <ol>
        <li>Implement the GET /api/presets endpoint in index.mjs</li>
        <li>Implement the GET /api/presets/:name endpoint in index.mjs</li>
        </li>
    </ol>
    <p>For the first one: GET /api/presets endpoint, you should return the list of JSON
        files located in the public/presets folder as an array of objects.</p>

    <p>
        For the second one: GET /api/presets/:name endpoint, you should return the
        content of the preset JSON file as an object.
    </p>

    <h3>On the front-end part:</h3>
    <p>You should create a simple client for this API in this index.html file.</p <p>Use the <code>fetch</code> API to
    call these endpoints and display the results in
    this page.</p>

    <h2>Presets List</h2>
    <div id="presets-list"></div>

    <p>You will use the <code>js/script.js</code> file to write your JavaScript code,
        inspired the example from seance1 (ExampleF).</p>

    <h3>TODO for next session:</h3>
    <p>Look at the other folder with the solution. It shows how to implement
        the file upload feature with a HTTP POST route, how to remove presets
        (DELETE /api/presets/:name), how to upload multiple presets at once 
        (POST /api/presets:seed) etc. The code is still uncomplete but functionnal.</p>
        <p>What is a multipart form? How to send multipart data with JavaScript and the 
            Fetch API?</p>
        <p>How to use the multer module to handle file uploads in nodeJS with express?</p>
        <p>How to validate the content of a JSON file?</p>
        <p>How to debug fetch calls with the browser's developer tools?</p>
        <p>How can we test our POST routes without coding?</p>
